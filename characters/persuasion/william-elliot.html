                <h3 class="section-title">Character Overview</h3>
                <p>William Elliot presents a puzzle that Anne must solve. His attentions to her are flattering, his manners impeccable, his apparent reformation from a dissolute past convincing. Lady Russell is charmed; Sir Walter is gratified; even Anne finds herself drawn to a man who seems to value her as her family does not.</p>
                <p>Yet something about him troubles Anne from the start. His agreeableness is too complete, his opinions too accommodating. He says what everyone wants to hear, but Anne wonders what he actually thinks. His surface reveals nothing because there may be nothing beneath it—or something he wishes to hide.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Smith's revelations confirm Anne's instincts. William Elliot is not reformed but merely calculating. His interest in the Elliot family is purely mercenary—he wants to ensure no new heir displaces him. His attentions to Anne aim at securing her help in managing Sir Walter. His past treatment of Mrs. Smith and her husband reveals a man capable of genuine cruelty.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Character Arc</h3>
                <p>William Elliot's story begins before the novel opens, with his youthful estrangement from Sir Walter. He refused to court Elizabeth when encouraged, married instead for money, and expressed contempt for the baronetcy he stood to inherit. His former letter to Mr. Smith, scorning Sir Walter as a "fool," reveals his earlier attitude.</p>
                <p>His apparent reformation raises hopes. He appears in Bath newly attentive to Sir Walter, flattering about the family name, interested in Anne. His explanation—that maturity has taught him to value what he once scorned—seems plausible. Even Anne, who suspects something, cannot identify what troubles her.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Smith provides the missing information. William Elliot's return to Sir Walter's favor is purely mercenary: he fears Sir Walter might remarry Mrs. Clay and produce a male heir who would displace him. His interest in Anne stems from her potential usefulness in preventing this. He has no genuine attachment to anyone or anything except his own advancement.</p>
                <p>Exposed, William Elliot disappears from Bath with Mrs. Clay, presumably to use her as a tool in his ongoing schemes. His exit is appropriately anticlimactic—he simply leaves when his plot fails, seeking other means to his ends. Unlike a Gothic villain, he faces no dramatic punishment, just the continuation of his cold, calculating existence.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">The Wickham of Persuasion</h3>
                <p>William Elliot invites comparison with Wickham from Pride and Prejudice: both are charming men whose surfaces conceal selfish calculation. But while Wickham is careless and impulsive, William Elliot is controlled and patient. His villainy is colder, more calculated, more dangerous.</p>
                <p>Anne's ability to see through him where others fail reflects her mature judgment. Unlike Elizabeth Bennet, who initially trusted Wickham's charm, Anne is skeptical from the start. Her experience has taught her that perfect agreeableness often signals perfect emptiness.</p>
                <p>William Elliot also serves a structural function: his pursuit of Anne creates the jealousy that finally pushes Wentworth to declare himself. Without the threat of losing Anne to her cousin, Wentworth might have maintained his proud distance indefinitely. William Elliot's villainy thus inadvertently enables the happy ending he sought to prevent.</p>
                <p>His final fate—exile with Mrs. Clay, scheming presumably continuing—denies readers the satisfaction of seeing him punished. But this refusal of dramatic justice is itself realistic. Men like William Elliot often prosper in the world, and Austen will not pretend otherwise. His continued existence on the novel's margins reminds us that not all stories end with the villain defeated.</p>
