                <h3 class="section-title">Character Overview</h3>
                <p>Frederick Wentworth represents Austen's most romantic hero—a man whose feelings, unlike the reserved Darcy or the cool Knightley, run visibly deep. His bitterness at Anne's rejection, his determined pursuit of other women, his jealousy at William Elliot's attentions—all reveal a passionate nature barely under control.</p>
                <p>Eight years before the novel begins, Wentworth was a young commander without fortune, his prospects uncertain despite his talents. Anne's rejection, though she yielded to persuasion rather than acting from her own feelings, wounded him deeply. He left determined to prove himself and to forget her.</p>
                <p>He has succeeded in the first but failed in the second. The wars have made him wealthy; captured ships have provided the fortune he lacked. But Anne remains in his heart, and his return to her neighborhood forces him to confront feelings he thought he had conquered.</p>

                        <h4>Pride</h4>
                        <p>Wentworth's wounded pride drives much of the novel's tension. He cannot easily forgive Anne's rejection, though he still loves her.</p>

                        <h4>Passion</h4>
                        <p>Unlike Austen's more restrained heroes, Wentworth feels openly and deeply. His letter to Anne is the most passionate declaration in her novels.</p>

                        <h4>Honor</h4>
                        <p>Despite his feelings, Wentworth behaves honorably throughout. He believes himself bound to Louisa and is prepared to marry her until she releases him.</p>

                        <p>Wentworth must learn to forgive, to let go of his resentment, to see that Anne's submission to persuasion came from duty, not indifference.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Character Arc</h3>
                <p>Wentworth's return to Anne's world sets the novel in motion. He arrives at Kellynch as tenant to the Crofts, determined to marry—anyone but Anne. His pointed attentions to the Musgrove sisters, particularly the lively Louisa, seem designed to wound Anne while protecting himself.</p>
                <p>Yet his behavior betrays feelings he cannot entirely suppress. Small kindnesses—removing her troublesome nephew, ensuring she has a seat in the carriage—reveal continuing care. His anger at finding her in William Elliot's company suggests jealousy he has no right to feel.</p>
                <p>The accident at Lyme Regis proves transformative. When Louisa falls and lies unconscious, it is Anne whose calm competence manages the crisis. Wentworth sees, perhaps for the first time, what he lost eight years ago—not just a pretty girl but a woman of genuine strength and judgment.</p>
                <p>The months of Louisa's recovery give him time to recognize his mistake. He was attracted to Louisa's spirited resolution, her refusal to be persuaded—but he comes to see that such firmness can become mere stubbornness, while Anne's yielding to persuasion reflected proper deference, not weakness of character.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">The Letter</h3>
                <p>Captain Wentworth's letter to Anne is the most famous passage in Austen's work, the moment when his reserve finally breaks and his true feelings pour out. Written in haste while Anne speaks to Harville about women's constancy, the letter declares what Wentworth has been unable to say aloud.</p>
                <p>"You pierce my soul" announces a lover who can no longer hide behind pride or resentment. The phrase "half agony, half hope" captures perfectly the torment of loving without knowing if one is loved in return. His assertion that he has "loved none but you" and been "never inconstant" answers Anne's own claims about women's constancy with equal devotion.</p>
                <p>The letter represents Wentworth's final transformation. The proud man who returned to wound Anne with his indifference becomes the humble suitor who can only "lay at your feet" and await her answer. His willingness to be vulnerable, to risk rejection again, proves his love more eloquently than any protestation.</p>
                <p>This declaration makes Wentworth unique among Austen's heroes. Darcy's proposal, even his second one, remains somewhat formal; Knightley's confession happens largely off-page. Only Wentworth speaks with the full passionate intensity of romantic love, and his letter remains the emotional climax toward which the entire novel moves.</p>
