                <h3 class="section-title">Character Overview</h3>
                <p>Sir Walter Elliot is vanity incarnate. His two great passions are his baronetcy and his appearance—he studies the Baronetage for family pride and his mirror for personal admiration. These obsessions render him incapable of valuing anything that does not flatter his consequence or his looks.</p>
                <p>Anne, his middle daughter, suffers most from his shallowness. She lacks Elizabeth's beauty and Mary's married status; she does not reflect well on Sir Walter, and so he ignores her. Her intelligence, her integrity, her genuine worth—none of these register with a father who can only see surfaces.</p>
                <p>His financial irresponsibility forces the plot into motion. Years of extravagance beyond his income have created debts that require renting Kellynch Hall and retreating to Bath. Even this humiliation he manages to interpret as sophistication—Bath society is more elegant than country society, after all.</p>

                    <div class="trait-card">
                        <h4>Vanity</h4>
                        <p>Sir Walter's defining characteristic. He admires his own reflection, values only those who reflect well on him, and measures all worth by appearance and rank.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="trait-card">
                        <h4>Snobbery</h4>
                        <p>He despises anyone of inferior rank. His contempt for the navy—men who have risen by merit rather than birth—reveals his shallow values.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="trait-card">
                        <h4>Foolishness</h4>
                        <p>Sir Walter lacks even basic intelligence. He is easily manipulated by flattery, blind to obvious deceptions, and incapable of learning from experience.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="trait-card">
                        <h4>Neglect</h4>
                        <p>His self-absorption leaves no room for genuine concern for others. He neglects Anne completely while spoiling Elizabeth, who flatters his vanity.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="trait-card">
                        <h4>Extravagance</h4>
                        <p>He spends far beyond his means to maintain appearances. His debts force the rental of Kellynch Hall—the ultimate humiliation for one who values consequence.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="trait-card">
                        <h4>Superficiality</h4>
                        <p>Nothing matters to him but surfaces. He judges people by their complexions, their dress, their titles—never their characters or accomplishments.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">The Baronetage</h3>
                <p>Sir Walter's favorite reading matter is the Baronetage—specifically, the entry for "Elliot of Kellynch Hall." This book, which documents the family's noble lineage, provides him with endless self-satisfaction. He has even annotated the entry with the names of heirs and the dates of marriages.</p>
                <p>This detail perfectly captures Austen's satire. Sir Walter reads only about himself; he finds no book so absorbing as the chronicle of his own consequence. His world extends no further than his own family tree, his own estate, his own reflection.</p>
                <p>The Baronetage also represents the empty values Sir Walter embodies. It records only rank and connection, birth and death—nothing of character, achievement, or worth. It is the perfect book for a man who can see nothing beyond these superficial distinctions.</p>

                <div class="quote-block">

                <p>Sir Walter Elliot is funny—perhaps the funniest character Austen ever created. His objection to the navy because it destroys men's complexions, his horror at Mr. Shepherd's freckles, his counting of ugly women in Bath—these moments of pure absurdity make him a comic masterpiece.</p>
                <p>Yet beneath the comedy lies serious critique. Sir Walter represents the worst of the aristocratic class: its empty pride, its contempt for merit, its worship of birth over worth. In a novel that celebrates the self-made naval officers, Sir Walter embodies everything the navy's meritocracy opposes.</p>
                <p>His treatment of Anne particularly indicts his values. Here is a daughter of genuine intelligence and feeling, and her father cannot see her at all. His blindness to Anne's worth measures the extent of his moral bankruptcy. He is not cruel so much as simply empty—there is nothing inside him but vanity.</p>
                <p>Sir Walter remains unchanged at the novel's end. He does not learn, does not grow, does not even recognize that anything has happened. Anne's happiness with Wentworth means nothing to him except that her husband is now wealthy enough to be acknowledged. His shallowness is impervious to experience, immune to wisdom. He will die as he lived: reading his own name in the Baronetage.</p>
