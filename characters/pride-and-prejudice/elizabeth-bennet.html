                <h3 class="section-title">Character Overview</h3>
                <p>Elizabeth Bennet stands as one of the most beloved heroines in English literature. Unlike many female protagonists of her era, she refuses to conform to society's expectations of passive femininity. Her sharp intelligence, playful wit, and strong sense of self make her a remarkably modern character despite her Regency setting.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth's defining characteristic is her quick, discerning mind. She prides herself on her ability to read people's characters, though this very pride leads to her initial misjudgment of both Darcy and Wickham. Her journey throughout the novel is one of genuine self-discovery, as she learns that first impressions can deceive and that she is as capable of prejudice as anyone.</p>
                <p>What makes Elizabeth truly exceptional is her refusal to compromise her integrity for social or economic advantage. She rejects Mr. Collins despite the practical benefits of such a match, and famously refuses Darcy's first proposal because it insults her family and reveals his pride. Her moral courage sets her apart in a society where women had few choices.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Character Arc</h3>
                <p>Elizabeth's journey in Pride and Prejudice is fundamentally one of self-discovery. At the novel's opening, she prides herself on her discernment and ability to judge character. This confidence leads her to trust the charming Wickham and dismiss the apparently proud Darcy.</p>
                <p>The turning point comes with Darcy's letter after his rejected proposal. Reading his explanation of his dealings with Wickham and his reasons for separating Bingley from Jane, Elizabeth undergoes a profound transformation. "Till this moment I never knew myself," she admits, recognizing how her prejudice blinded her to the truth.</p>
                <p>From this point, Elizabeth approaches the world with greater humility and openness. She reassesses Darcy, seeing past his reserve to the principled, generous man beneath. Her visit to Pemberley and her observation of how his servants regard him further opens her eyes to his true character.</p>
                <p>By the novel's end, Elizabeth has grown from a clever but somewhat arrogant young woman into someone capable of genuine self-reflection and change. Her marriage to Darcy represents not just romantic fulfillment but a union of true equals who have both learned and grown.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Mr. Darcy:</strong> Their relationship evolves from mutual antagonism to deep love. Elizabeth challenges Darcy to confront his pride, while he teaches her about her own prejudices. Their intellectual equality and moral growth make them Austen's most celebrated couple.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Jane Bennet:</strong> Elizabeth's closest confidante and the sister she most resembles in character. Elizabeth's protectiveness of Jane drives much of her initial dislike of Darcy and Bingley's sisters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mr. Bennet:</strong> Elizabeth is her father's favorite, sharing his wit and love of the ridiculous. However, she grows to see his detachment and failure to properly guide the family as harmful.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Charlotte Lucas:</strong> Elizabeth's pragmatic friend whose marriage to Mr. Collins challenges Elizabeth's romantic ideals about marriage and highlights the limited choices available to women.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Mr. Wickham:</strong> His charm initially deceives Elizabeth, and her trust in him exemplifies her susceptibility to first impressions. His true nature reveals her capacity for misjudgment.

                <p>Elizabeth Bennet remains literature's most beloved heroine because she feels startlingly modern despite her Regency setting. Her refusal to settle, her intellectual confidence, her wit, and her capacity for growth resonate with readers across generations and cultures.</p>
                <p>Austen herself called Elizabeth "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." Unlike the passive heroines common in novels of the period, Elizabeth is active, opinionated, and willing to challenge authority. She speaks her mind to everyone from Lady Catherine to Darcy himself.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, Elizabeth is flawed in realistic, relatable ways. Her pride in her own judgment and her prejudice against Darcy are mistakes any reader might make. Her journey toward self-knowledge offers hope that we too can recognize our biases and become better people.</p>
