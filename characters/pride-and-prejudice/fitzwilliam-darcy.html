                <h3 class="section-title">Character Overview</h3>
                <p>Fitzwilliam Darcy enters the novel as a figure of fascination and resentment. At the Meryton assembly, he is immediately judged proud and disagreeable, refusing to dance and declaring Elizabeth Bennet merely "tolerable." This first impression sets up the central conflict of the novel.</p>
                <p>Yet beneath Darcy's reserve lies a man of genuine worth. His apparent pride stems partly from natural shyness and partly from the weight of his position in society. As master of Pemberley and guardian to his young sister, he bears responsibilities that have shaped him into someone cautious and reserved rather than easily amiable.</p>
                <p>Darcy's transformation throughout the novel is not about becoming a different person, but about learning to express his true nature. Elizabeth's rejection forces him to confront how his behavior appears to others and to become, as he says, what he "ought to be." His growth into vulnerability and openness makes him all the more appealing.</p>

                        <h4>Pride</h4>
                        <p>Darcy's pride in his position and family initially blinds him to his own behavior and the genuine worth of those he considers beneath him.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="trait-card">
                        <h4>Intelligence</h4>
                        <p>A well-educated man of keen perception, Darcy matches Elizabeth intellectually and is drawn to her wit and intelligence.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="trait-card">
                        <h4>Reserve</h4>
                        <p>His natural shyness and discomfort in company are mistaken for arrogance. He struggles to make small talk with strangers.</p>

                        <h4>Generosity</h4>
                        <p>Darcy is genuinely generous to those he cares for, supporting his sister, his tenants, and ultimately the Bennet family.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Character Arc</h3>
                <p>Darcy's character arc mirrors Elizabeth's journey of self-discovery. His first proposal reveals a man convinced of his own superiority, unable to see how his condescension appears to others. He offers marriage while simultaneously insulting Elizabeth's family and social position.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth's fierce rejection shatters his complacency. Her accusation that he did not behave in a "gentleman-like manner" cuts him to the quick because he has always prided himself on being a gentleman. This moment forces genuine self-reflection.</p>
                <p>Darcy's letter represents his first step toward vulnerability, explaining his actions while acknowledging his struggles with manner and expression. His later behavior—treating the Gardiners with genuine warmth, secretly resolving the Wickham scandal—shows growth into action rather than words.</p>
                <p>By the novel's end, Darcy has learned that true gentility lies in behavior, not birth. His second proposal comes with humility, openness to rejection, and genuine gratitude when accepted. He has become worthy of Elizabeth not by changing his essential nature but by learning to express his best qualities.</p>

                <p>Mr. Darcy has become the archetype of the romantic hero for good reason. He represents the appealing fantasy of being seen and loved by someone who initially seemed indifferent—the transformation of disdain into devotion.</p>
                <p>Yet Darcy's appeal goes deeper than fantasy. His growth feels genuine because it is earned through struggle and self-reflection. He does not change his essential nature but learns to express his better qualities. The reserved man of the novel's beginning and the devoted lover of its end are recognizably the same person.</p>
                <p>Darcy also appeals because he acts. When the Bennet family faces ruin through Lydia's elopement, he works tirelessly behind the scenes to resolve the crisis, asking for neither credit nor gratitude. His love manifests in deeds, not just words.</p>
                <p>Perhaps most importantly, Darcy loves Elizabeth precisely for the qualities that make her challenging—her wit, her spirit, her refusal to flatter him. He wants not a submissive partner but an equal, someone who will "liveliness of mind" will continue to challenge and delight him for a lifetime.</p>
