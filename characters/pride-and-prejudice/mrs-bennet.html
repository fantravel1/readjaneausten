                        <p>The anxious, vulgar, and frequently ridiculous mother of five daughters, Mrs. Bennet's sole mission in life is to see her girls married. Her famous nerves, social climbing, and embarrassing behavior provide endless comedy, yet her desperate matchmaking reflects the genuine economic vulnerability of women in her era.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Character Overview</h3>
                <p>Mrs. Bennet is introduced in the novel's opening pages with devastating precision: "She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news."</p>
                <p>This description establishes Mrs. Bennet as a figure of fun, and she never disappoints. Her schemes to promote her daughters, her embarrassing behavior in company, and her endless complaints about her nerves make her one of Austen's most memorable comic creations.</p>
                <p>Yet there is a genuine anxiety beneath the comedy. Mrs. Bennet understands something that her husband ignores: when he dies, the entail will give Longbourn to Mr. Collins, and his widow and unmarried daughters will be left with almost nothing. Her obsession with marriage, however vulgar its expression, reflects real economic terror.</p>

                    <blockquote>"You have no compassion for my poor nerves."<br>"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least."</blockquote>

                <h3 class="section-title">The Matchmaking Mother</h3>
                <p>Mrs. Bennet's matchmaking efforts are relentless and frequently counterproductive. She pushes Jane at Bingley so obviously that it contributes to Darcy's belief that Jane is not genuinely attached. Her behavior at the Netherfield ball—boasting loudly of Jane's prospects—mortifies Elizabeth and confirms Darcy's worst impressions of the family.</p>
                <p>When Mr. Collins arrives to choose a wife from among her daughters, Mrs. Bennet is initially delighted, seeing it as two birds with one stone: a daughter married and the estate secured. Her fury when Elizabeth refuses him is volcanic, though her anger at losing such an "advantageous" match reveals more about the economic realities she understands than about maternal feeling.</p>
                <p>Her reaction to Lydia's elopement—first horror at the scandal, then delight when they marry, regardless of the circumstances—shows her values clearly. A married daughter, however disgraced, satisfies her more than an unmarried one. She cannot understand why the rest of the family does not share her joy.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Sympathetic Undertones</h3>
                <p>Modern readers often find more to sympathize with in Mrs. Bennet than Austen's contemporaries might have. She is married to a man who openly despises her, who retreats from family life to mock her from behind his library door. Her nerves, while comic, may reflect genuine distress at her situation.</p>
                <p>Her obsession with marriage, while vulgar, is not irrational. She has five daughters and limited means; without husbands, they will face poverty when Mr. Bennet dies. The entail that will give everything to Mr. Collins is a genuine threat that Mr. Bennet refuses to take seriously.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Bennet is not a good mother, but she is not an indifferent one. She cares passionately about her daughters' futures, even if her methods are counterproductive and her values skewed. In her way, she is fighting for her family's survival in a society that offers women few weapons.</p>
