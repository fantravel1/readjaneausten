                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Fanny Dashwood enters the novel as a force of cold, calculating selfishness. Where her husband John has weak good intentions, Fanny has none at all. She sees the Dashwood sisters not as family to be helped but as rivals to be defeated—competitors for money that should belong to her son Harry.</p>

                    <div class="quote-block">
                        "Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it."

                    </div>

                    <p>Her arrival at Norland before the old Mr. Dashwood is even buried demonstrates her priorities: securing property matters more than propriety. She immediately makes Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters feel like unwelcome guests in what was their home, driving them to seek accommodation elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>Yet Fanny maintains perfect respectability. She commits no obvious offenses against good manners; she simply pursues her interests with relentless efficiency. Society tolerates her because she violates no rules—only expectations of basic human kindness.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The conversation in which Fanny talks John out of helping his sisters stands as one of Austen's most brilliant comic achievements. John begins resolved to give three thousand pounds—his father's dying wish. Fanny proceeds to demolish this intention through a series of seemingly reasonable objections.</p>

                    <p>Three thousand is too much—think of little Harry. An annuity then? But Mrs. Dashwood might live forever. Perhaps occasional gifts? But they have china and linen already. Really, any help would be excessive—the sisters have five hundred pounds a year between them. They will live quite comfortably. John owes them nothing.</p>

                    <div class="quote-block">
                        "Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be reasonably expected of you."
                        <cite>— Fanny Dashwood, reinterpreting her father-in-law's dying wish</cite>
                    </div>

                    <p>What makes the scene devastating is John's eager acceptance of each argument. He wants to be convinced; Fanny merely provides the logic. By conversation's end, he believes giving nothing constitutes generous attention to family duty.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Thematic Significance</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Fanny Dashwood embodies the mercenary values the novel critiques. For her, every relationship is transactional, every connection evaluated by financial return. Love, duty, gratitude—these words have no meaning except as they serve material interests.</p>

                    <p>She represents the worst aspects of the property system that governs Austen's world. Inheritance law favors men; women's security depends on men's generosity. When that generosity fails—when men like John Dashwood allow wives like Fanny to override moral obligation—women suffer. The Dashwood sisters' precarious position results directly from Fanny's influence over her husband.</p>

                    <p>Yet Fanny faces no consequences for her behavior. She prospers, inherits further wealth, and maintains her position in society. Austen offers no poetic justice, no comeuppance for her villainy. This is perhaps the novel's bleakest observation: in a world that values property over principle, those who pursue property most ruthlessly often succeed.</p>

                    <p>Fanny also illuminates the limitations of "sense" divorced from feeling. She is perfectly rational—she calculates interests, weighs advantages, pursues logical ends. But her rationality serves selfishness rather than virtue. True sense, the novel suggests, must be tempered by sensibility—by feeling for others, by recognition of moral obligation beyond material interest.</p>
