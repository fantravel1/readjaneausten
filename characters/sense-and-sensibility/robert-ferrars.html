                <h2 class="section-title">Character Overview</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Robert Ferrars makes one of literature's most memorable entrances: spending a quarter of an hour choosing a toothpick case at a jeweler's while Elinor and Marianne wait to be served. His absorption in this trivial purchase&mdash;examining case after case, debating minutely with himself&mdash;captures his character perfectly. He is a man for whom appearances are everything.</p>

                    <div class="quote-block">
                        "At last the affair was decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care."
                        <cite>&mdash; Sense and Sensibility, on Robert Ferrars at the jeweler's</cite>
                    </div>

                    <p>Where Edward is modest, serious, and indifferent to fashion, Robert is vain, frivolous, and obsessed with style. The brothers could hardly be more different. Robert represents everything the novel criticizes: superficiality elevated to philosophy, self-importance mistaken for substance.</p>

                    <p>His opinions are delivered with complete confidence despite their obvious foolishness. He attributes all Edward's difficulties to having been educated privately rather than publicly, claiming that a public education would have given Edward proper spirit. The argument is absurd&mdash;Robert himself is the product of public education&mdash;but delivered with perfect self-satisfaction.</p>

                            <p>His absorption in dress, accessories, and appearance borders on obsession. The toothpick case scene establishes vanity as his defining characteristic.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Astonishing Marriage</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Robert's marriage to Lucy Steele stands as the novel's most unexpected plot development. Lucy, engaged to Edward for four years, jilts him for his brother the moment she realizes Robert now controls the family fortune. Robert, presumably seeking only to separate Lucy from Edward, finds himself caught by her superior scheming.</p>

                    <p>The marriage is mutual exploitation. Lucy wants Robert's money and position; Robert wants... what exactly? Austen leaves his motivations mysterious, perhaps because they are shallow enough to resist explanation. Lucy's arts have worked on someone even vainer than herself.</p>

                    <div class="quote-block">
                        "The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest... will do in securing every advantage of fortune."
                        <cite>&mdash; Sense and Sensibility, on Lucy's triumph</cite>
                    </div>

                    <p>The marriage's aftermath provides the novel's sharpest irony. Mrs. Ferrars, who disinherited Edward for refusing to abandon Lucy, eventually forgives Robert for actually marrying her. The mother who demanded Edward sacrifice honor for obedience forgives the son who sacrificed nothing. Her principles prove meaningless when tested.</p>

        <section class="section">

                <h2 class="section-title">Thematic Significance</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Robert Ferrars embodies the novel's critique of a society that values appearance over substance. His obsession with toothpick cases and fashionable dress represents the trivial concerns that pass for importance among the ton. He is what Edward refused to become: a creature of surface and show.</p>

                    <p>His acquisition of Edward's inheritance illuminates the injustice at the heart of the story. Robert gains everything through no merit of his own, merely because Edward possessed the integrity to honor his engagement. The younger brother's triumph is entirely unearned&mdash;he is rewarded for being shallow when Edward is punished for being principled.</p>

                    <p>His marriage to Lucy creates an ending that is almost too perfect in its justice. Two schemers, each thinking themselves cleverer than the other, bound together for life. Lucy has secured her fortune; Robert has acquired a wife whose cunning exceeds his own. They deserve each other, and the novel leaves them to that fate.</p>

                    <p>Robert Ferrars represents what the novel defines itself against: a world where the right toothpick case matters more than the right principles, where manner trumps matter, where fortune rewards not virtue but vanity. His success is the novel's satire; his marriage to Lucy is its revenge.</p>
