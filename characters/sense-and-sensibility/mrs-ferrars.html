                <h2 class="section-title">Character Overview</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Mrs. Ferrars is introduced long before she appears, her shadow falling over the narrative through Edward's anxieties and Fanny's machinations. When she finally enters, she proves worse than expected: a small, thin, disagreeable woman whose ill-temper shows in her face and whose rudeness to Elinor is calculated and cruel.</p>

                    <div class="quote-block">
                        "Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect. Her complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and naturally without expression."
                        <cite>&mdash; Sense and Sensibility, describing Mrs. Ferrars</cite>
                    </div>

                    <p>Her treatment of Elinor at the dinner party&mdash;pointedly praising Lucy Steele's screens while ignoring Elinor's superior work&mdash;demonstrates her capacity for petty cruelty. She doesn't yet know Lucy is her rival for Edward; she merely wishes to wound the woman she suspects of attracting him. This gratuitous meanness defines her character.</p>

                    <p>Her power over her children stems entirely from her control of the family fortune. Edward's independence, his choice of a profession she despises, and his secret engagement all represent resistance to her tyranny. Her threat to disinherit is her only weapon, and she wields it ruthlessly.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Disinheritance</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>When Edward's secret engagement to Lucy Steele is revealed, Mrs. Ferrars responds with furious disinheritance. She strips Edward of his birthright, settling everything on Robert instead. Her rage is absolute: she will not see Edward, will not hear his name, will not forgive him.</p>

                    <p>The irony is savage. Edward's "crime" is honoring an engagement made in youth&mdash;a youthful folly, certainly, but one he refuses to escape dishonorably. His constancy, which should be praiseworthy, becomes his offense. He will not jilt Lucy to please his mother, and for this integrity he loses everything.</p>

                    <div class="quote-block">
                        "She would never see him again, nor mention his name; and she would not even allow Edward to be considered, even for a moment, as her son."
                        <cite>&mdash; Sense and Sensibility, on Mrs. Ferrars's response to Edward's engagement</cite>
                    </div>

                    <p>Robert's subsequent marriage to Lucy&mdash;the very woman for whom Edward was disinherited&mdash;exposes the absurdity of Mrs. Ferrars's position. She has punished Edward for refusing to abandon Lucy, then forgiven Robert for actually marrying her. The inconsistency is complete.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="section-title">Thematic Significance</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Mrs. Ferrars represents parental tyranny exercised through financial control&mdash;a theme that runs through much of Austen's work. Her power over her children exists only because she controls the money. Without her fortune, she would have no leverage; with it, she can threaten, punish, and coerce.</p>

                    <p>Her eventual forgiveness of Robert while Edward remains unforgiven (until his marriage to Elinor) illuminates the arbitrary nature of such power. Her principles are not principles at all, merely preferences. Lucy, the scheming social climber, wins her over through flattery; Edward, the honest son, remains in disgrace because he refused to grovel.</p>

                    <p>The novel's resolution quietly rebukes Mrs. Ferrars. Edward and Elinor find happiness despite her opposition; their modest income proves sufficient for contentment. Her threats prove empty: she cannot actually prevent her son's happiness, only delay it. Financial tyranny, the novel suggests, is ultimately impotent against genuine love.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Ferrars never becomes a warm mother, never truly reforms. Her partial reconciliation with Edward is grudging, motivated by Robert's worse behavior rather than her own recognition of Edward's worth. She remains what she always was: a small, cold woman whose power exceeded her wisdom.</p>
